# PI-TIMOLO plugins

## Introduction
Plugins configure pi-timolo for special tasks by overlaying
the plugin variables over the current config.py settings.
Plugin Files can be found in the pi-timolo/plugins subfolder.
You can customize a particular plugin or create your own.   
***IMPORTANT*** Do Not delete the `__init__.py` file since it is required in order to import plugins.
